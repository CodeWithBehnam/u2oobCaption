    types: [labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  update-status:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move to In Review
        if: github.event.action == 'opened'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        # Move related issues to "In Review" column

      - name: Move to Done
        if: github.event.action == 'closed' && github.event.pull_request.merged

- `githubRepo`: Repository patterns and implementation analysis
- `extensions`: Tool and integration capability assessment

**Development Support**:
- `runCommands`: Command execution and validation
- `runTerminalCmd`: Terminal-based testing and verification
- `editFiles`: File modification and implementation support

### Automation Strategy
1. **Issue Creation**: Automated creation of work item hierarchy
2. **Status Updates**: Automated movement through project board columns
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Automated identification of blocking relationships
4. **Quality Gates**: Automated validation of DoR and DoD criteria
5. **Reporting**: Automated generation of progress and status reports

This comprehensive project planning and tracking system ensures complete traceability from epic-level business objectives down to individual implementation tasks, with automated tracking, quality assurance, and stakeholder communication throughout the development lifecycle.
