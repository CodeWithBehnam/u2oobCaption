# No Comments Unless Requested â€” Always Apply

Do not add comments in code, docs, or responses unless explicitly requested by the user.

- Prefer self-documenting names and clear structure over comments.
- Avoid narration or explanatory comments in code or messages.
- If the user requests comments, add only what is requested.
