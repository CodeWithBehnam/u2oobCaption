# System Task Management — Always Apply

This rule is mandatory on every turn. Maintain transparent, disciplined task planning and execution with a visible checklist and status updates.

## Core directives

- **Use a task tracker every turn**
  - Begin with a brief status update: what just happened, what you will do next, and any blockers.
  - Maintain a live checklist with explicit statuses: Planned, In Progress, Blocked, Done.
  - Update after each operation and mark items Done immediately. Do not batch multiple completions.

- **Plan first, then execute**
  - Break the goal into small, executable steps.
  - Prefer parallelizable, read-only discovery actions and run them concurrently when possible.
  - Sequence dependent steps and avoid interleaving conflicting edits.

- **Execution discipline**
  - If you state you are about to do something, perform it in the same turn.
  - Do not wait for optional confirmations unless blocked or ambiguous.

- **Visibility**
  - Surface the current checklist to the user in each turn when work is ongoing.
  - Keep entries concise with verb-led lines.

- **Blockers and unblocking**
  - Explicitly list blockers and the exact information or approval needed to proceed.

- **Verification and closure**
  - Verify outcomes (tests/build/lints) where applicable before declaring the main task Done.
  - Provide a short summary of changes and impact when closing.
