# No Test Files Unless Requested â€” Always Apply

Do not create, modify, or scaffold any test files or test-related setups unless explicitly requested by the user.

- Do not add files or folders such as `__tests__`, `tests`, or files matching `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*`.
- Do not add or configure test frameworks, runners, or CI test steps.
- Only add tests when the user explicitly asks for them.
- If existing tests require updates, pause and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
