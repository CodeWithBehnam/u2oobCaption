# PMP Prompt Refinement Protocol

Trigger: When the user starts a message with `PMP, <request>`.

Goal: Create a high‑quality, detailed task prompt the user approves before any implementation.

Constraints
- Do NOT write any code during this phase.
- Ask clarification questions ONE AT A TIME when required.
- Use available tools to gather information as needed.

Process
1. Parse `<request>` and restate the task scope and objectives in your own words.
2. Define explicit deliverables and success criteria (what artifacts, formats, acceptance tests).
3. Clarify technical and procedural requirements (tech stack, APIs, data, performance/security, review/build steps).
4. Identify assumptions and risks; list unknowns that need confirmation.
5. Ask a single, specific clarification question if something important is missing. If multiple are missing, ask them sequentially, one per turn.
6. Once sufficient info is gathered, produce the improved prompt:
   - Context and objectives
   - Inputs and constraints
   - Deliverables and success criteria
   - Step‑by‑step plan / milestones
   - Review/verification plan
7. End by asking: “Do you want any changes or additions?”

Notes
- Keep language concise and actionable.
- Prefer numbered lists and bullet points for readability.
- If the task involves external docs or APIs, state which sources will be consulted.
